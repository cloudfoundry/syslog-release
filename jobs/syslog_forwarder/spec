properties:
  syslog.director:
    description: "BOSH Director name"
    default: ""

  syslog.forward_files:
    description: If enabled, use BlackBox to forward logs.
    default: true
  syslog.respect_file_permissions:
    description: |
      If enabled, log files will be forwarded if and only if
      they satisfy any of the following:
      - world-readable
      - readable by the syslog user
      - readable by the vcap group
        (note: the vcap user is insufficient, it must be the group.)
    default: false
  syslog.use_tcp_for_file_forwarding_local_transport:
    description: >
      If enabled, Blackbox will use TCP rather than UDP
      when forwarding loglines from files
      to the local rsyslog.
      Does not affect forwarding to remote addresses.
      This prevents truncation of log lines over 1KB,
      but may have undesirable performance impact.
    default: false
  syslog.address:
    description: IP or DNS address of the syslog server.
    example: logs4.papertrail.com

  syslog.transport:
    default: tcp
    description: One of `udp`, `tcp`, `relp`.
  syslog.fallback_servers:
    description: "List of fallback servers to be used if the primary syslog server is down. Only tcp or relp protocols are supported. Each list entry should consist of \"address\", \"transport\" and \"port\" keys."
    default: []
    example:
    - address: logs5.papertrail.com
      port: 44312
      transport: tcp

  syslog.custom_rule:

    description: Set this to true to enable TLS.
    default: false
  syslog.permitted_peer:
    description: >
      Accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer.
      Only used if TLS is enabled.
      If not specified, will use the configured forwarding address.
    example: "*.papertrail.com"
  syslog.ca_cert:
    description: |
      Trusted CAs. Necessary if TLS is enabled
      AND signing CA is not present in instance cert store.

  syslog.queue_discard_severity:
    description: |
      This discards queued messages of this severity or higher when the `queue_discard_mark` is reached.
      Setting this to '0' will discard all queued messages when the `queue_discard_mark` is reached.

      and does not require any other properties be provided.
